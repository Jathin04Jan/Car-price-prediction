# Car Price Prediction Web App

## Overview

This project is a web application that predicts the selling price of a car based on certain features. It is built using Streamlit for the front-end and a Linear Regression model trained with scikit-learn for the prediction.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git`
2. **Install the required dependencies**: `pip3 install streamlit`
4. **Run the application**: `streamlit run 'homepage.py'`

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input details about a car, such as the make year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner.
- **Prediction**: The application uses a trained machine learning model to predict the car's price based on the provided inputs.
- **Easy Deployment**: The application can be easily deployed on platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS.

## Usage

- **Input Fields**: Use the input fields to provide details about the car.
- **Predict Price Button**: Click the 'Predict Price' button to see the predicted selling price of the car.
- **Interpretation**: The predicted price is displayed on the screen, providing an estimate of the car's value.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit**: The web application framework used for the front-end.
- **scikit-learn**: The machine learning library used for training the model.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries used for data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib**: Library used for data visualization.
